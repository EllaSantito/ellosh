# ellosh

Pretty much an unnamed videogame development project by me and my partner in crime. (Shush, do not warn the police!)
We end up calling it project "ellosh", it's a mash up of our name Ella and Josh. (cute eh?)

Anyhoo, we currently on storyline development stage. Which is going to be kickass.

Once done, we will take you to the world of adventure across time and space.
Imagine getting caught inside an interspecies political turmoil across the galaxy.
Saving planets from certain dooms.
Probably even resolve some family issues.
Sounds fun, eh?

Stay tune for more update.

With love,
Ella & Josh.

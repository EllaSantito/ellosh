Storyline 

- Villain, the Emperor, have an extended life span by killing kin
	- (Isn't that going to make him seems greedier?)
	- (Oh, wait, "Greed"! One of the deadly sin!)
	- (We can use that plus making other villains with the other deadly sins)
	- (They can be the head of the "Rebels" and make it like one of the big one)
	- (Let me figure it out later)
- When his child was born, he grew fond of the idea of being a father
	- (Really weak idea, need more exploration)
- But in one side, he realizes that his life can only be taken by his child
	- (This makes him feels threaten, kinda)
	- (Like it's a royal thing, that's why the rebel "kidnap" his child)
- The Rebels exist to fight the Emperor’s tyranny
- The Rebels knows about the “can only be killed by its own kin” thing
	- (But that means the royal family must’ve have different “thing”)
	- (Or different species)
	- (But wouldn’t that would make it too obvious?)
